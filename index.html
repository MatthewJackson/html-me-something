                <h2><u>Family</u></h2>
                <p>
                I am 30 years old. I just recently married in August to my beautiful wife Shayla. I also inherited an amazingly smart, although troublesome step son Noah. 
                We live in St. Peters, MO in a beautiful but soon to be already cramped townhome.  Soon to be cramped because we found out a week after getting married we were expecting another addition to the family, a little boy.  We thought we had a name picked out but it's not for sure anymore.
                We also have three dogs.  Roscoe, Riley, and Paco.  Two may as well be considered horses though as they are as big as a mini horse.

                <h2><u>My Profession</u></h2>
                <p>
                    I currently switched careers in October to a great company called Presto-X, a branch of Rentokil North America.  It's in corporate pest control.
                    I never thought I would end up enjoying a job where I'm outside in the cold but so far I really like it.  
                    I like jobs that challenge me and allow me to learn something new.  In this case I wanted to learn a trade.  It also gave me the ability to take this class. Which my previous job would not have let me do.
                    I spend most of my days servicing warehouses but also places you don't think about. Such as restaurants, hospitals, and hotels.  That's not to say they have issues but my job is to help prevent pest issues, not react to them.
                    So far I've really enjoyed it.

                <h2><u>Future</u></h2>
                <p>
                    To be honest, I'm not 100% sure what the future holds for me.  I hope that it involves programming.
                    I feel like I've been falling behind week after week but I truly enjoy it so far.  Once I start to get the hang of each section that is.
                    I hope to be able to get the building blocks I need from this class to pursuea career in programming.  And so far I'm starting to enjoy web development.
